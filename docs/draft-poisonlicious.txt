                 Synchronizing caches of DNS resolvers
                         draft-poisonlicious-00

Abstract

   Network of cooperating and mutually trusting DNS resolvers could
   benefit from cache sharing, where one resolver would distribute the
   result of a resolution to other resolvers.  This document
   standardizes a protocol to do so.

1.  Introduction

   When an organisation operates a big network of DNS resolvers
   [RFC1034] [RFC1035], for instance for an important public resolver
   (Section 6 of [RFC9499]), it may be a performance improvment to
   distribute the result of the resolution process between the
   resolvers.  This document standardizes how to to do so, using
   blockchains (just kidding) and unicast messages to a set of pre-
   configured peers.

   TODO data from Quad9 to show that there is a caching improvment to
   expect.  Measuring the efficiency of caching optimizations is hard!

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   Network of resolvers (TODO or resolver set?)
      A set of resolvers working together under the same administration

   Peer (or peer resolver)
      One of the other resolvers in the network

   Originating resolver
      A resolver sending data to its peers in the network

   Receiving resolver (or receiving peer)
      A resolver receiving data from one of its peers in the network

   Resolver
      As used in [RFC9499] section 6

2.  The protocol

   When completing a successful DNS resolution, the resolver transmits a
   DNS message (with the Q/R bit set, since it is a response) to the
   pre-configured peers, authenticating with TSIG [RFC8945].  TODO SIG0?
   DoT?  No acknowledgment is sent or expected.

   The resolver must send only data that it is sure of (for instance by
   DNSSEC valitaion or because it came with the AA bit from the queried
   server).  Since all of the netwok of resolvers are in the same
   organizational domain, they MUST agree on the same policy for this
   assessment.

   Messages of this protocol are distinguished from other DNS messages
   by the TSIG key they use (which must therefore be specific to this
   protocol).  TODO or by a dedicated port?

   This message MAY be the message received by the resolver from the
   authoritative name servers or it MAY be a new message with data
   composed from data already obtained by the resolver.  TODO privacy
   risks when sending the question section?  Force its elision?

   The EDNS section MUST be a new one, created to fit the needs of
   successful transmission to the peer.  TODO what about ECS?

   Each peer then MAY store the data in its cache.  The peer is not
   supposed to do DNSSEC validation (there is not always all the
   necessary data in the message).  TODO cache only what is in the
   Answer section?  See above about assessing the trustiness of the
   data.

3.  IANA Considerations

   None.  [RFC-Editor: you may delete this section]

4.  Security Considerations

   The integrity and authenticity of the cached data is of course
   critical.  DNSSEC would help but it is not yet universally deployed
   and, moreover, the peer resolvers should not have to redo the
   validation.  So, trust between the peer resolvers is expected.  One
   way to do so is to have all of them under the same organisational
   authority, as mandated here.

   The channel between peers must be protected, preferrably with
   cryptography (currently, TSIG is mandatory).

   Encryption is less important than authentication since we transmit
   only public data.  Nevertheless, it is better to be sure that the
   channel between the peers is not open to snooping.

5.  Operational Considerations

   It is reminded that all resolvers in the network need to trust each
   other, probably being in the same administrative domain.  This
   specification is not meant to be deployed between unrelated
   resolvers.

   The netwok of peer resolvers have to be configured out-of-band
   before.  The way to do it is out-of-scope for this specification.

6.  Related and future work

6.1.  Related work

   [I-D.hl-dnsop-cache-filling] describes a mechanism to fill DNS caches
   with data.  The format is, like in this document, standard DNS as
   ween on the wire.

6.2.  Future work

6.2.1.  Negative answers

   TODO What to do about them?  Transmit them?  (Be careful of the risk
   of overloading receving peers for instance when there is a dictionary
   attack.)  Can a receiving peer use [RFC8020] an/or [RFC8198] to
   synthetize negative answers since it did not validate data itself?

6.2.2.  Transport of messages

   It may be interesting to replace the unicasts messages by multicast
   (the issues of multicast on the public Internet do no apply here
   since we envision work under only one organisation).  For instance,
   if we use DoT for the transport of messages and if there are 1,000
   servers, having a full mesh of DoT connections may be too much.

   Is the use of a DHT reasonable?  Why not MQTT [MQTT] which is well
   suited for publish-by-one/consume-by-many?  What about protocols like
   protocol buffers?  TODO What about dnstap?

6.2.3.  Packing of messages

   It could be interesting to optimize by packing the data in a C-DNS
   [RFC8618] flow, sent with TCP (with TLS) or QUIC.  (Of course, other
   formats/protocols are possible.)
