# Cache Poisonlicious

## Problem Statement

---

## Large Scale Public DNS Resolvers

- Multiple resolvers running in the same administrative domain
- Resolvers are oblivious to the content of other resolvers' cache
- A resolver must perform full resolution for a request, even though the answer is most likely known and cached by another resolver in the same cluster.

---

## Key Issue

- **Cold Resolver:** A new or inactive resolver has to query the root servers, leading to longer response times and unnecessary traffic.
- **Caching:** Existing resolvers in the cluster might already have the data but cannot share it.

## Cache Warm up

## Why It Matters

- **DNS Traffic:** Constant requests to root DNS servers increase internet traffic and strain the infrastructure.
- **Warm-Up Delays:** New resolvers (or cold resolvers) need time to populate their caches, causing slower responses.
- **Efficiency Loss:** Without data sharing between resolvers, the system becomes inefficient when the same queries are made frequently.

---

## The Proposed Solution:
### Sharing Cache Information Across Resolvers

---

## Data Format

- Resolvers share cached data in the **DNS Wire Format**.

- Allows seamless communication between resolvers in the same cluster.

---

## **Data Sharing Mechanism:**

- When a resolver enoucnters a new answer, it shares it with other resolvers in the same cluster.
  
---

## Challenges

---

### Integrity

- Ensuring that cached data shared between resolvers is accurate and up-to-date.

---

### Security

- Security concerns like cache poisoning are not considered as we assume the system operates within an autonomous boundary, reducing the risk of malicious activity.

---

### Noise

- A resolver with a cold cache can pollute communication channel.

---

### Scalability

- Designing the system to handle a high volume of requests and data sharing efficiently.

---

## Achievement in hackathon

- Drafted an RFC
- Proof-of-concept implementation in Unbound

---

## Key Takeaways:

- By sharing cached DNS data in the DNS wire format, DNS resolvers can serve data faster, reduce unnecessary root DNS queries, and improve overall system efficiency.
- The approach helps DNS networks scale more efficiently while keeping the internetâ€™s DNS traffic sustainable.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Security:** Implement tests to ensure data accuracy and address security concerns.
2. Functional Tests - Study different scenarios in a lab (or production) environment.
3. **Deployment:** Gradually roll out the system to a subset of DNS resolvers.
4. Work with the community in IETF meetings to make this a formal standard.
